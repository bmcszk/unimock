/*
Package model provides data structures used by Unimock for mocking HTTP responses and scenarios.

There are two main types:

1. MockData - Represents stored mock data for regular mocking
2. Scenario - Represents predefined scenarios for specific API endpoints

These structures are used both internally by the Unimock server and can be used
by client applications to interact with the Unimock API.
