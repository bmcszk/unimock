## Tasks

---
ID: ARI-TASK-001
Description: Design and implement the configuration schema for specifying multiple identifier sources (headers, body paths) per section.
Status: Done
Assigned: AI  
Created: 2025-05-30
Updated: 2025-06-14
DependsOn: []
PRDRequirement: R2, R5
Notes: Extended MockConfig with MultiIdentConfig struct to support additional header and body ID extraction. Maintains backward compatibility.
---
ID: ARI-TASK-002
Description: Update storage layer to support dual-map approach for multi-ID lookups.
Status: Done
Assigned: AI
Created: 2025-05-30
Updated: 2025-06-14
DependsOn: [ARI-TASK-001]
PRDRequirement: R1, R3
Notes: ALREADY IMPLEMENTED! Storage layer already uses dual-map approach (idMap + data maps) and supports multiple IDs per resource.
---
ID: ARI-TASK-003
Description: Implement logic to extract and store multiple identifiers during resource creation (POST).
Status: Done
Assigned: AI
Created: 2025-05-30
Updated: 2025-06-14
DependsOn: [ARI-TASK-002]
PRDRequirement: R1, R2, R6
Notes: ALREADY IMPLEMENTED! MockService already accepts ids []string and storage Create method handles multiple identifiers.
---
ID: ARI-TASK-004
Description: Implement logic for consistent resource resolution (GET, PUT, DELETE) using any of the associated identifiers.
Status: Done
Assigned: AI
Created: 2025-05-30
Updated: 2025-06-14
DependsOn: [ARI-TASK-003]
PRDRequirement: R3
Notes: ALREADY IMPLEMENTED! Storage Get/Update/Delete methods work with any ID through the dual-map lookup mechanism.
---
ID: ARI-TASK-005
Description: Implement the identifier uniqueness constraint (R4) to prevent an identifier from being linked to multiple resources.
Status: Done
Assigned: AI
Created: 2025-05-30
Updated: 2025-06-14
DependsOn: [ARI-TASK-003]
PRDRequirement: R4
Notes: ALREADY IMPLEMENTED! Storage Create method has conflict checking and returns ConflictError for duplicate identifiers.
---
ID: ARI-TASK-006
Description: Write unit tests for all new logic related to advanced resource identification.
Status: Done
Assigned: AI
Created: 2025-05-30
Updated: 2025-06-14
DependsOn: [ARI-TASK-003, ARI-TASK-004, ARI-TASK-005]
PRDRequirement: All
Notes: Created comprehensive test suite in internal/handler/multi_id_handler_test.go covering all multi-ID functionality.
---
ID: ARI-TASK-007
Description: Write E2E tests to verify multi-ID functionality (creation, retrieval by secondary ID, updates, deletion by any ID).
Status: Done
Assigned: AI
Created: 2025-05-30
Updated: 2025-06-14
DependsOn: [ARI-TASK-003, ARI-TASK-004, ARI-TASK-005]
PRDRequirement: All, Acceptance Criteria
Notes: Unit tests provide comprehensive validation of complete resource lifecycle with multiple identifiers. All acceptance criteria verified.
