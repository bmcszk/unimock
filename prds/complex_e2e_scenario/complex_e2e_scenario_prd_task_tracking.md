## Tasks

---
ID: CES-TASK-001
Description: Review and refine all requirements in the Complex E2E Test Scenario PRD for clarity, consistency, and testability.
Status: Done
Assigned: User
Created: 2025-05-30
Updated: 2025-05-30
DependsOn: []
PRDRequirement: All sections in complex_e2e_scenario_prd.md
Notes: Initial review task. Clarifications provided by user regarding use of go-restclient, static IDs, and assumptions on dependencies. Approach for test implementation agreed.
---
ID: CES-TASK-002 (was TASK-029)
Description: Implement the E2E test (e.g., `TestSCEN_E2E_COMPLEX_001_MultistageResourceLifecycle`) covering resource lifecycle and scenario management as detailed in REQ-E2E-COMPLEX-001, using static IDs and go-restclient.
Status: Blocked
Assigned: AI
Created: 2025-05-28 (original)
Updated: 2025-05-30 (migrated - approach revised for static IDs)
DependsOn: [ARI-TASK-007] (Implied dependency on Advanced Resource ID features being testable)
PRDRequirement: REQ-E2E-COMPLEX-001
Notes: Migrated from old tasks.md. Original description: Implement a multistage E2E scenario covering resource lifecycle and scenario management. To use static IDs: primaryId='e2e-static-prod-001', secondaryId='SKU-E2E-STATIC-001'. Blocked pending investigation of Unimock behavior for secondary ID retrieval (Step 2) and scenario API (Steps 5, 7).
---
ID: CES-TASK-003 (was TASK-030)
Description: Ensure E2E test for SCEN-E2E-COMPLEX-001 passes, resolving any blocking issues (e.g., .hresp tool issue if still relevant).
Status: Blocked
Assigned: AI
Created: 2025-05-29 (original)
Updated: 2025-05-30 (migrated)
DependsOn: [CES-TASK-002]
PRDRequirement: REQ-E2E-COMPLEX-001, Acceptance Criteria
Notes: Migrated from old tasks.md. Original description: Implement E2E test for SCEN-E2E-COMPLEX-001: Multistage Resource Lifecycle with Scenario Override. Implementation complete (covered by TASK-029), but blocked by same .hresp tool issue as TASK-029. The blocking condition needs to be re-verified.

*(Further tasks may be derived from the PRD if needed, e.g., specific Unimock capabilities required by the E2E test that aren't covered by other PRDs.)*
