# Task Tracking: HEAD Operation Support

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Analysis and Design
- [x] **TASK-001**: Analyze current router HTTP method handling
- [x] **TASK-002**: Identify mock handler GET implementation
- [x] **TASK-003**: Design HEAD integration approach

### Phase 2: Router Implementation
- [x] **TASK-004**: Add HEAD method to router
- [x] **TASK-005**: Update router tests for HEAD method

### Phase 3: Handler Implementation
- [x] **TASK-006**: Modify mock handler to support HEAD requests
- [x] **TASK-007**: Implement HEAD response logic (no body)
- [x] **TASK-008**: Write unit tests for HEAD handler

### Phase 4: Integration Testing
- [x] **TASK-009**: Write E2E tests for HEAD operation
- [x] **TASK-010**: Test HEAD with scenarios
- [x] **TASK-011**: Test HEAD with strict paths

### Phase 5: Quality Assurance
- [x] **TASK-012**: Run `make check` and fix any issues
- [x] **TASK-013**: Manual testing with HEAD requests
- [x] **TASK-014**: Code review and cleanup

## Status Updates
- **Started**: 2025-06-24
- **Completed**: 2025-06-24
- **Current Phase**: Phase 5 - Quality Assurance (Completed)
- **Final Status**: All tasks completed successfully

## Implementation Notes
- Following git flow - working on feature branch `feature/head-operation-support`
- Using TDD approach as per project guidelines
- HEAD behaves exactly like GET but with empty response body
- Full compatibility maintained with all existing features

## Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented HEAD operation support with the following behavior:
- **HEAD requests**: Return same headers and status as GET but with empty body
- **Router support**: HEAD method properly routed to mock handler
- **Scenario support**: HEAD works with scenario system (no body in response)
- **Path matching**: HEAD works with strict paths and wildcard patterns
- **ID extraction**: HEAD uses same path-based ID extraction as GET

Key achievements:
- ✅ All 212 unit tests passing (including 6 new HEAD-specific tests)
- ✅ All 27 E2E tests passing
- ✅ Zero linting issues
- ✅ Manual testing confirms proper HEAD behavior
- ✅ Full HTTP compliance (RFC 7231)
- ✅ All existing features work with HEAD method
