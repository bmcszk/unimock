## Tasks

---
ID: SPM-TASK-001
Description: Add strict_path configuration field to Section struct
Status: Done
Assigned: AI
Created: 2025-06-23
Updated: 2025-06-23
DependsOn: []
PRDRequirement: REQ-PATH-001, REQ-PATH-004
Notes: ✅ Completed: Added StrictPath bool field to config.Section with comprehensive documentation and default false value for backward compatibility.
---

---
ID: SPM-TASK-002
Description: Add constants and enhance wildcard pattern support for ** notation
Status: Done
Assigned: AI
Created: 2025-06-23
Updated: 2025-06-24
DependsOn: []
PRDRequirement: REQ-PATH-002
Notes: ✅ Completed: Added RecursiveWildcard constant and implemented enhanced pattern matching logic for ** wildcards with full recursive support.
---

---
ID: SPM-TASK-003
Description: Implement enhanced pattern matching engine for * and ** wildcards
Status: Done
Assigned: AI
Created: 2025-06-23
Updated: 2025-06-24
DependsOn: [SPM-TASK-002]
PRDRequirement: REQ-PATH-002
Notes: ✅ Completed: Implemented comprehensive pattern matching with matchRecursiveSegments function supporting both * and ** wildcards, with proper handling of zero, single, and multiple path segments.
---

---
ID: SPM-TASK-004
Description: Update MockConfig.MatchPath to support enhanced wildcard patterns
Status: Done
Assigned: AI
Created: 2025-06-23
Updated: 2025-06-24
DependsOn: [SPM-TASK-003]
PRDRequirement: REQ-PATH-002, REQ-PATH-004
Notes: ✅ Completed: Enhanced MatchPath with pattern prioritization (exact > single wildcard > recursive wildcard) and comprehensive scoring system for best match selection.
---

---
ID: SPM-TASK-005
Description: Modify GET handler to enforce strict path matching when enabled
Status: Done
Assigned: AI
Created: 2025-06-23
Updated: 2025-06-24
DependsOn: [SPM-TASK-001]
PRDRequirement: REQ-PATH-003
Notes: ✅ Completed: Updated GET handler to enforce strict path validation when strict_path=true. Individual resource requests return 404 if resource doesn't exist, regardless of strict_path setting.
---

---
ID: SPM-TASK-006
Description: Modify PUT handler to disable upsert when strict_path enabled
Status: Done
Assigned: AI
Created: 2025-06-23
Updated: 2025-06-24
DependsOn: [SPM-TASK-001]
PRDRequirement: REQ-PATH-003
Notes: ✅ Completed: Modified PUT handler to check resource existence when strict_path=true and return 404 for non-existent resources (no upsert behavior). Refactored for better cognitive complexity.
---

---
ID: SPM-TASK-007
Description: Modify DELETE handler to enforce exact resource existence when strict_path enabled
Status: Done
Assigned: AI
Created: 2025-06-23
Updated: 2025-06-24
DependsOn: [SPM-TASK-001]
PRDRequirement: REQ-PATH-003
Notes: ✅ Completed: Updated DELETE handler to validate resource existence when strict_path=true and return 404 for non-existent resources. Refactored for better cognitive complexity.

---
ID: SPM-TASK-008
Description: Create unit tests for strict_path configuration field
Status: Done
Assigned: AI
Created: 2025-06-23
Updated: 2025-06-24
DependsOn: [SPM-TASK-001]
PRDRequirement: AC-001
Notes: ✅ Completed: Created comprehensive tests for YAML parsing, default values (false), and field accessibility. Added 175 unit tests total including strict path configuration tests.
---

---
ID: SPM-TASK-009
Description: Create unit tests for enhanced wildcard pattern matching
Status: Done
Assigned: AI
Created: 2025-06-23
Updated: 2025-06-24
DependsOn: [SPM-TASK-003, SPM-TASK-004]
PRDRequirement: AC-002
Notes: ✅ Completed: Created extensive unit tests for single *, recursive **, complex mixed patterns, pattern priority scoring, and backward compatibility. All wildcard patterns tested thoroughly.
---

---
ID: SPM-TASK-010
Description: Create integration tests for strict path behavior in handlers
Status: Done
Assigned: AI
Created: 2025-06-23
Updated: 2025-06-24
DependsOn: [SPM-TASK-005, SPM-TASK-006, SPM-TASK-007]
PRDRequirement: AC-003
Notes: ✅ Completed: Created comprehensive integration tests for GET/PUT/DELETE behavior with both strict_path=true and strict_path=false, testing all scenarios from the PRD.
---

---
ID: SPM-TASK-011
Description: Create end-to-end tests for all test cases in PRD
Status: Done
Assigned: AI
Created: 2025-06-23
Updated: 2025-06-24
DependsOn: [SPM-TASK-010]
PRDRequirement: All Test Cases in PRD
Notes: ✅ Completed: All E2E tests pass (27 tests). Implemented all test cases from PRD including strict path scenarios, wildcard patterns, and mixed wildcards. Server startup and shutdown working correctly.
---

---
ID: SPM-TASK-012
Description: Verify backward compatibility with existing configurations
Status: Done
Assigned: AI
Created: 2025-06-23
Updated: 2025-06-24
DependsOn: [SPM-TASK-009, SPM-TASK-010]
PRDRequirement: AC-004
Notes: ✅ Completed: All existing tests pass (175 unit tests, 27 E2E tests). Configurations work without changes. Default strict_path=false maintains existing behavior.
---

---
ID: SPM-TASK-013
Description: Update documentation and configuration examples with clarified behavior
Status: Done
Assigned: AI
Created: 2025-06-23
Updated: 2025-06-23
DependsOn: [SPM-TASK-011]
PRDRequirement: Section "Migration Strategy"
Notes: ✅ Completed: Updated PRD, config comments, handler comments, and test descriptions to clarify that strict_path=true requires BOTH path pattern match AND exact resource ID existence. Updated descriptions to distinguish between strict_path=true (exact matching) and strict_path=false (flexible matching with fallbacks).
